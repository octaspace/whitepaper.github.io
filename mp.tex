\section{Monetary Policy}
\label{sec:mp}

\textbf{OCTA} is the primary payment instrument and the currency used to pay for the services provided by OctaSpace, as well as rewards to node owners and dividend payments for OCTA holders.

In order to maintain stable inflation levels, OctaSpace implements a finite monetary policy.

The policy consists of a series of eras, each with a set duration and total coin supply. The block reward for each era is gradually reduced, as shown in Table 1, to decrease inflation and ensure a controlled supply of OCTA tokens.


In summary, the finite monetary policy ensures that the supply of OCTA tokens remains stable and controlled, while also providing rewards to those who contribute to the network through mining and staking. The gradual reduction of block rewards in each era helps to decrease inflation and maintain a healthy token economy for the long-term benefit of the OctaSpace community.

This policy should decrease inflation by changing amount of block reward dependents of era.

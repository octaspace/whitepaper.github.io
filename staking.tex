\section{Staking}
\label{sec:staking}

To incentivize interest in holding, a staking mechanism is introduced. People who lock some amount of coins and run a node are rewarded. To activate staking, the following requirements must be met:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Collateral - 100\_000 OCTA
    \item Node reliability for the last 30 days $\ge$ 75\%
    \item Node must be verified
\end{itemize}

To begin staking, you need an address wallet with sufficient funds and link it to an existing node. Rewards will be sent to the provided wallet.

If the system detects a balance lower than the collateral, staking will be disabled for that wallet-node pair for several rounds.

\subsection{Reward distribution scheme}

The billing period is 1 week (every 7 days).

Assuming that block time is always 15 seconds, the amount of blocks mined would be:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 1 minute - 4
    \item 1 hour - 240
    \item 1 day - 5760
    \item 7 days - 40320
    \item 30 days - 172800
\end{itemize}

We will use the reward amount for the Arcturus and Oldenburg eras to calculate; 1.5 OCTA from each block goes to the staking fund.

In total, 60480 OCTA will be mined in 1 week.

Let's say 10 nodes are in operation; the 60480 OCTA will be shared between them in the following proportion:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 60\% (base reward) - 36240 OCTA, 3624 for each node
    \item 20\% (gpu reward) - 12080 OCTA, 1208 for each node which provide renting service with GPU
    \item 10\% (vpn reward) - 6040 OCTA, 604 for each node which provide VPN service
    \item 10\% (rent reward) - 6040 OCTA, 604 for each node which provide renting service
\end{itemize}

If there are no nodes to which 40\% of coins (except for the base reward) can be distributed, the coins will remain in the staking fund for the next round.

The most profitable variant is to have a node with a GPU that provides both services. Such a node will receive 6040 OCTA per week, as well as additional payments for service usage.

Using the current scheme, we can calculate a minimal monthly return on investment (ROI) as follows:

\[
    ROI = \frac{MonthReward / Collateral * 100}{N} = \frac{M}{100} * 60
\]

Where \textbf{MonthReward} is 172800 blocks multiply by staking reward according to current era.

\textbf{N} is amount of nodes participated in staking, for example 10.

Therefore the minimal ROI for Arcturus and Oldenburg eras will be:

\[
    ROI = \frac{172800 / 100000 * 100}{10} = \frac{17.28}{100} * 60 = 10.36\%
\]

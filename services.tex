\subsection{GPU marketplace}

OctaSpace offers a unique GPU marketplace where users can rent or rent out GPU compute power. Our GPU rental service provides users with the ability to leverage powerful GPUs for tasks in AI/ML, CGI rendering, and other fields that require high-performance computing. Our support for both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs expands the range of tasks that can be tackled.

Users can securely access their rented GPU instances through the SSH protocol, and also have the option of using Jupyter\cite{jupyter}and LiveBook\cite{livebook} systems for interactive access. By combining rented GPU instances into a cluster, users can develop and execute distributed programs. For instance, users can use TensorFlow or PyTorch for distributed training of ML models. 

Our aim is to empower users with the resources they need to solve complex problems and accelerate their projects by providing powerful and flexible GPU rental options.

\section{Services}

OctaSpace is committed to providing services that address the needs of end-users, offering solutions to everyday problems. These services range from performing complex calculations to simple file sharing between friends, and more. Our team is continually striving to bring new and innovative services to our users, and we are excited to share with you some of the services that we have already implemented or plan to implement in the near future.

We believe that our services will be of significant interest to users and will have practical applications in their daily lives. Our goal is to continually improve and evolve our offerings to meet the changing needs of our users. 

\subsection{GPU marketplace}

The unique GPU marketplace where users can rent or rent out GPU compute power, our GPU rental service provides users with the ability to leverage powerful GPUs for tasks in AI/ML, CGI rendering, and other fields that require high-performance computing. Our support for both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs expands the range of tasks that can be tackled.

Users can access their rented GPU instances via the secure SSH protocol, and also have the option of using Jupyter\cite{jupyter}and LiveBook\cite{livebook} systems for interactive access. These rented GPU instances can be combined into a cluster, allowing for the development and execution of distributed programs. For instance, users can use TensorFlow or PyTorch for distributed training of ML models.

By providing powerful and flexible GPU rental options, we aim to empower users with the resources they need to solve complex problems and accelerate their projects.

\subsection{VPN}

OCTA VPN\cite{VPN} offers a variety of key benefits to its users.
One of the main advantages is its ease of setup, which is made possible by utilizing non-modified and open-source software that is compatible with a wide range of platforms.

Additionally, users have the flexibility to choose from a variety of VPN technologies to suit their needs.
There are also no limitations on the number of devices that can be connected simultaneously.

To add to that, the billing model is pay-as-you-go, which means you are billed only for the amount of data you use.
This gives you complete control over your usage and costs.

Service donâ€™t any logging of the user traffic or DNS requests.

VPN access is implemented using the following technologies:

\begin{itemize}
    \item WireGuard
    \item ShadowSocks
    \item OpenVPN
\end{itemize}

In the future more VPN types will be added, including some to bypass China's golden shield (Great Firewall of China).
\subsection{Remote Video Gaming}

Many have tried and failed with Stedia recently falling. All these services essentially rely on massive centralized server farms which inherently introduces huge latency issues resulting in bad gaming experience if your not located with 100km of the facility.

But with OctaSpace and enough nodes it may finally be possible for a remote gaming service to be widly used utilizing nodes across the globe allowing gamers to use share unused hardware. By connecting to say your neighbours unused pc would solve the major problem of latency in remote gaming services.

\subsection{HashCache}

HashCache is a Password Recovery service for performing password cracking operations on a large scale. It utilizes multiple nodes working together in a coordinated manner to speed up the cracking process. This is achieved by dividing the cracking workload among the nodes, allowing them to work in parallel on different parts of the task.

The system is designed to be highly configurable and can be optimized for different types of cracking operations, such as dictionary attacks, brute force attacks, and others.

\subsection{Distributed Rendering}

Another service example would be a distributed handbrake video encoding network. To allow content creators or studios to quickly render out massive edits economically.

\subsection{Instant File Sharing}

This service provide a easy way to upload a file, share a short link, and after it is downloaded, the file is completely deleted.

Key benefits:

\begin{itemize}
    \item All files are encrypted
    \item It's possible to set expiration (Time To Live), after such period file will be deleted
    \item Simple RESTful API
\end{itemize}

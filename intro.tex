\section{Introduction}

OctaSpace is a cloud platform with the idea to implement services build on top of hardware provided by users.

With OctaSpace, you can tap into the power of CPU and GPU resources from nodes all over the world to tackle heavy tasks.
And if you have spare hardware, you can even become a host and earn by renting out your CPU/GPU or traffic.

The sort of hardware may vary, from low-performance devices or cheap VPS to mining rigs and carrier-grade servers located in data centers.

The project goals are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Provide a marketplace for renting computer power focusing on GPU instances
    \item Implement a VPN marketplace using popular VPN technologies
    \item Provide infrastructure to deploy applications and databases mostly close to the end users
    \item Implement distributed data storage and use it as a backbone for CDN service
\end{itemize}

The sort of tasks the project focused on:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Machine Learning
    \item CGI rendering
    \item Digital image processing
    \item Scientific modeling
    \item Data storing and distributing
    \item VPN technologies
    \item Other tasks/fields which require massive computation power to get be solved
\end{itemize}

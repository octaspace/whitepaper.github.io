\section{Introduction}
The backbone of the internet infrastructure is controlled by cloud compute providers that process and store essentially the entire world's data.

With a handful of providers gaining more share each year, the cost of compute will only continue to rise, reducing the number of services that can operate.

To address this, OctaSpace takes a distinct approach by utilizing spare unused compute across the globe to build a scalable distributed compute system that presents itself to users as a unified entity.

With centralization, the need for redundancies also spreads, which increases costs and resources.
These weaknesses can be avoided by utilizing spare unused compute across the globe.

It's essential to have the system with unified interfaces and coherent behavior, providing a single entry point for the end-users' interactions similar to how cloud providers operate today.

With OctaSpace, you can harness the power of CPU, GPU, storage, and traffic resources from Octa nodes across the world to tackle compute-heavy tasks.

By utilizing your spare hardware, it's possible to generate income by acting as a host and renting out your CPU/GPU or traffic.

The hardware required for this can range from basic, low-performance devices or inexpensive VPS to advanced mining rigs and carrier-grade servers located within data centers.

OctaSpace's features and goals:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Utilize a powerful of Hybrid 51\% attack proof blockchain to increase transparency.
    \item Provide easy-to-use interface for describing nodes and executing tasks and marketplace for renting computer focusing on GPU instances
    \item Provide infrastructure to deploy applications and databases mostly close to end-users
    \item Implement a VPN marketplace using popular VPN technologies
    \item Implement distributed data storage and use it as a backbone for CDN service
    \item Increase OctaSpace accessibility globally
\end{itemize}
